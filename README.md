Additionally, I wrote a lot of Typescript and Java code in repos under other organizations;

If you want to send me an email, my email is `{first_name}.{last_name}314@gmail.com`.

I am comfortable with (in approximate order of experience):

- Python
- TypeScript
  - Most of my work here is under private repos
- Java
- Rust

I have fleeting experience with C.
