## lore
- I wrote a little toolpathing software at [Freeform](https://freeform.co) for a LPBF 3D printer.
- I wrote a bunch of bare-metal firmware + realtime vehicle software at [Parallel Systems](https://moveparallel.com) so that the vehicle could comply with relevant parts of Title 49 CFR Part 229.
- In college, I competed in 7 hackathons, doing a number of them with [my friends](https://github.com/Minihacks).
- Between high school and college, I used to do full-stack web dev in TypeScript (Angular + NestJS).
- In high school, I used to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition, writing autonomous control algorithms in Java + doing a lot of 3D modelling in SolidWorks [for FRC2502](https://github.com/Team-2502).
- i like rats and potatoes a LOT.
